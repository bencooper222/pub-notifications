# Disclaimers

## Functionality
This is a best effort project. I might screw up and something might go wrong. If it doesn't text you, sorry. 

## Storage
I store your phone number in Google's cloud until your order is called. After that, it is deleted. I have not spent the time to fully secure this setup. It's possible that if someone cared enough to hack this, they could steal your phone number. That also applies if you do something stupid like entering your social security number instead of your phone number. 

Twilio also does provide me with a log of numbers texted. If Twilio gets hacked, your number could get exposed.
